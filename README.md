Please Note that you must have github installed on your PC, this can be done [here](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03).


### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written using ruby, `Ruby Runtime >= 1.9` is required to interpret the code. If you don't have ruby runtime already setup on your computer, follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

### Usage

After cloning on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/command prompt window and run

`bin/main.rb`

### Web Scraping :: Introduction
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. [read-more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)

### How to use the Scraper
- The app scrapes a webpage consisting of a Complete JavaScript Modern Tutorial, their categories with the links respectively.
- It displays the result on the command prompt / terminal.
- Users can decide to use any of the three scrape options available.
- When the app is started (`bin/main.rb`), the app instructs the user to choose from the displayed options.<br>
